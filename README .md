 Tomato: A Food Delivery App

Tomato is a full-featured, responsive food delivery application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Stripe payment integration. This project delivers a seamless experience for customers, administrators, and delivery personnel, combining a user-friendly frontend, a robust backend, and an intuitive admin panel into a single, comprehensive platform. 

 Features

 Customer Interface (Frontend)
- Responsive Design: Developed with React, Tomato offers a fully responsive interface that adapts to various devices, from desktops to mobile screens, ensuring an optimized user experience.
- User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage sessions and protect user data.
- Browse and Search: Users can browse restaurants, view menus, and search for food items by category, popularity, or dietary preference.
- Order Management: Customers can place orders, select their preferred delivery address, and track the status of their orders in real-time.
- Payment Integration: With Stripe integrated, users can make secure, hassle-free payments directly within the app.
  
 Admin Panel
- User Management: Admins can view and manage user accounts, including customer and delivery personnel information.
- Menu and Restaurant Management: Easily add, edit, and delete food items, categories, and restaurant details to keep the offerings up to date.
- Order Tracking: Real-time monitoring of active and past orders, with controls to update the order status (e.g., received, in-progress, completed, delivered).
- Analytics: Track key metrics like popular items, order frequency, and user activity to make informed decisions and improve services.

 Backend (Server)
- API Development: Built with Express, the backend provides RESTful APIs to handle requests, manage authentication, and connect the frontend and admin panel to the MongoDB database.
- Data Storage: MongoDB is used for storing user profiles, order details, restaurant data, and menu items in a scalable and efficient manner.
- Real-Time Updates: With WebSockets, users receive live updates on their order status from the moment they place it until delivery.
- Security: Data protection and secure endpoints, with encrypted user information and secure payment processing via Stripe.

 Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, CSS3, Bootstrap/Material UI for styling, and Stripe integration for payment processing.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js, and WebSockets for real-time updates.
- Database: MongoDB for efficient, scalable data storage.
- Payment Integration: Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing.
